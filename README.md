## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to specific pattern directory
3. Run the example implementation
4. Review test cases

## Testing
Each pattern implementation includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Example usage scenarios

## Academic Context
These implementations were developed as part of coursework at SUNY Binghamton, demonstrating understanding of:
- Object-oriented design principles
- Design pattern applications
- Software architecture concepts
